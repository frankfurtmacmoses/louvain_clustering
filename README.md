What is the Louvain Method?
Louvain clustering algorithm is network clustering belonging to Partition Clustering Approach
The Louvain Method is an algorithm for finding communities in a network (or graph). A community is a group of nodes (like people, websites, or computers) that are more closely connected to each other than to nodes in other groups.
How Does it Work?
Start with the Graph:
Imagine you have a network (graph) of nodes connected by edges. Each edge might have a weight, showing how strong the connection is (e.g., a friendship strength).
Step 1: Assign Each Node to Its Own Community:
In the beginning, every node is its own community. So, if there are 10 nodes, there are 10 communities.
Step 2: Merge Communities to Maximize Modularity:
Modularity is a score that measures how good a division of the graph is. It checks:
Are nodes in the same community highly connected?
Are nodes in different communities less connected?
The algorithm tries to move each node into a neighboring community (one it’s connected to) if it improves the modularity.
This step is repeated until no further improvement is possible.
Step 3: Build a New Graph with Communities as Nodes:
After Step 2, each community becomes a single node in a new graph.
The edges between these new nodes are based on the total weight of connections between the communities.
Step 4: Repeat the Process:
Steps 2 and 3 are repeated on the new graph. Each iteration reduces the number of communities further.
The process stops when the modularity score cannot improve anymore.
Final Output:
You end up with a set of communities, where each community contains nodes that are more connected to each other than to nodes in other communities.
Simple Example
Let’s say you have a network of friends, where:
Nodes = people.
Edges = strength of their friendship.
Initial Setup:
Everyone starts in their own community.
First Pass:
Alice and Bob are good friends (strong edge). The algorithm merges them into the same community.
Second Pass:
The merged community (Alice and Bob) is now treated as a single unit.
If Alice, Bob, and Charlie are all closely connected, the algorithm merges Charlie into the same community.
Why Is It Useful?
The Louvain method helps:
Detect social groups in social networks.
Identify functional modules in biological networks.
Organize webpages into related clusters.
Key Points for Beginners
Communities = Groups of nodes closely connected.
Modularity = Score to check how good the communities are.
The algorithm works in two main steps:
Optimize modularity locally.
Aggregate nodes into communities and repeat.
